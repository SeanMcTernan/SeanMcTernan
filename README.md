# Hi I'm Seán 👋

I am a software developer who is passionate about the outdoors 🌱🌲, I like to merge my two passions whenever I can! Right now I am working on an open source river gauge system to communicate flow data from a remote river to kayakers. As I live in beautiful British Columbia, cellphone coverage is not an option, so we must look to the skies and use satellites 🛰️.
