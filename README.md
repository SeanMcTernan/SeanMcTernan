# Hi I'm Seán 👋

<!--
**SeanMcTernan/SeanMcTernan** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a sopftware developer who is passionate about the outdoors 🌱🌲, I like to merge my two passions whenever I can! Right now I am working on an open source river gauge system to communicate flow data from a remote river to kayakers. As I live in beatutiful British Columbia, cellphone coverage is not an option so we must look to thes skies and use satelites 🛰️. 

I like to use NodeJS, React, Javascripts, AWS and Firebase. That being said, I love learning new technologies so if the project requires it, I'll likely learn it!
